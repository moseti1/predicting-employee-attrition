# Predicting Employee Attrition Using Python 

This project employs the use of data science to to analyze and make predictions on how likely an employees are likely to leave a company X. 


## Project Set Up and Installation

This will simplify much of the installation needed to get started.


For local development, you will need to setup a jupyter lab instance.
* Follow the [jupyter install](https://jupyter.org/install.html) link for best practices to install and start a jupyter lab instance.
* If you have a python virtual environment already installed you can just `pip` install it.

The tools used in this project are typical python data science tools. They can be install by python packaging manager (`pip`). [more info!](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)





## Dataset
The provided dataset is the employee attrition dataset provided by Hash Analytics.
The project is designed to be dataset independent so if there is a dataset that is more interesting or relevant to your work, you are welcome to use it to complete the project.


## Project Description

The aim of this project is to analyze and predict how likely employees are to leave a company. This can be fueled by a number of factors like `salary`, `working hours`, `satistifaction level` , `evaluation` among many more. 

To understand these factors we explore our data using data sciece techniques such as visulization, feature selection, prediction and other.


## Results 

By visualizing `dept` and `Attrition` columns we see that most of the employees who left are from the `sales` department. Below is the bar chart.
